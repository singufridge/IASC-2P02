        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
        <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

        <p>...what looks to be merely a circle, static and sharp in shape, sits in front of the people of the cave, as if only a blemish on the stone or the opening of a hole. In fact, to some inside, it barely occurs to them that this spot could be something apart from the cave at all. But then, something changes—<span class="clickable" id="first-change">the circle transforms,</span> long ridges now chipped into it from the bottom, no longer so gaping and full. Or perhaps it was squished, they ponder, its juices trickling down like long legs as it bleeds out? But then, <span class="clickable" id="second-change">something happens to the legs,</span> beginning to push and pull them apart, back and forth, as if each were dancing to the same tune. For some, it is dizzying to look at, the flattened shape at the top unmoving as what were thought to be its legs somehow move independent of it. It looks to the people in the cave as if the legs are bumping into each other over and over, sliding along the flat surface above with ease until they come into contact with one, bouncing off until they hit another, in a quick, repeating sequence.
        </p>

        <p>How can you explain this conundrum from the perspective of someone from inside the cave? How can a circle transform itself, give itself legs? How can its legs slide along itself while nothing else is moving? If we view this concept through the lens of those inside, from those who view the world through flatness, we will never come to an answer. Flatness restricts understanding, withholds crucial information from us by simplifying what we see until the nuance is gone. Flatness gets rid of layers in our minds, refusing to let us interpret what might be happening beyond just what we see. There is no room for interpretation when reality can only be made up of two elements: the stone of the cave and the black of the shape. It is a monochromatic reality, causing the people of the cave to think that the shape they see must be a part of the cave itself, unable to conceptualize that the source could be coming from somewhere else. This follows with the “legs,” how the cave-dwellers see them as moving in a single file, bumping into each other with no way to get around.</p>


        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
        <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

        <p>…it is plain to see the source of the shadow—a carousel-like shape made up of a thin disc, eight cylinders extending below it, creating a look that could resemble the tentacles of a squid. The light behind it casts straight on to the cave, hiding the curves and three-dimensionality of the cylinders, causing the entire shape to look like an amalgamation of rectangles. When the shape starts to change once again, it <span class="clickable" id="third-change">floats from side to side,</span> still spinning like a carousel as it sways in a repetitive motion. In reality, the wind has picked up, causing the carousel to move with the current, swinging along to an invisible tune similar to how its legs move in the eyes of the cave-dwellers. As the sun sets and rises the next day, and those inside the cave are convinced the shape has long fallen off the face of the earth, <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">it returns,</span> yet lower this time. The dwellers are convinced that this is a different shape entirely, it’s top surface larger and covering some of its legs. However, those on the outside see the angle of the sun, how, from its afternoon position, it casts its rays down and unflattens the disc on top, revealing the true curve of its shape.
        </p>

        <p>While the cave-dwellers sit perplexed at how it is all possible, seeing only the flattened illusion of a greater story, those outside see both the shape and its shadow. They see how the light of the sun affects both of these entities, how one cannot exist without the other—the shadow a mold of the carousel, the carousel invisible if not for the light that casts the shadow. In seeing double, seeing the scene for both its truths, the shadow on the wall of the cave is no longer flat to those outside, but instead a reflection of the nuance of the shape it imitates. When the carousel spins around, those outside are able to see that the legs are not bumping into each other like the cave-dwellers think, but being pulled by the rotation of the disc, each in their own place as they travel from front to back and in front again. This understanding that comes from seeing double can make the shadow itself, even in all its flatness, start to have dimension, your eyes recognizing the layers that produce it. Suddenly, it is not just the wall and the shadow, but the wall, the sun, the wind, the shadow and the shape, and how they all contribute to a complete understanding that seems to change what you see.</p>
